                <h2>Some popular Bangladeshi Foods:</h2>
                <h3> 1. Tandori Chicken with Naan:</h3>
                <p>Almost every restaurant in Bangladesh serves this dish, and more than 50,000 grilled chickens are
                    sold every day
                    throughout the country. There are different ways of grilling chicken and there are many variations
                    of spices that are
                    used. Many restaurants roast chickens in a glass oven placed outside to entice people in to eat.
                    It’s a very successful
                    strategy.


                    Now, it is mostly eaten with Naan Roti. Naan Roti is an oven-baked leavened flatbread—the perfect
                    food with chicken. The
                    bread is a little sweet while the chicken is spicy. This combination creates a fabulous wild taste
                    in your mouth.

                <h3> 2. Panta Ilish:</h3>
                <p>Panta Ilish is a traditional food that almost every Bangladeshi eats at the Pohela Boishakh Festival
                    (the first day of
                    Bangla year). It’s the most popular food in Bangladesh. We love this dish as it is a great symbol
                    and celebration of our
                    culture and tradition.

                    It’s a platter of leftover rice soaked in water and served with fried hilsa, achar, and dal. People
                    eat Panta Ilish in
                    the morning of Pohela Boishakh and then take part in cultural programs. The flavorful, crispy, and
                    delicious hilsa fish
                    served with water-soaked cold rice and spicy bharta presents a combination of salty and chili
                    tastes. You will love it
                    after your first mouthful. Another fish, American shad, tastes like hilsa, so you can buy that and
                    have yourself some
                    Bengali pleasure.

                <h3> 5. Morog Polao:</h3>
                <p>Polao is a rice dish which involves cooking a stock, and adding spices. Other varieties of this
                    delicious,
                    mouth-watering food are Morog Polao or Chicken Polao, which is Polao served with chicken. Polao and
                    biryani are cooked with the same rice but they taste different because of the different variety of
                    spices
                    used. But when you are eating Morog Polao, you know you are not eating something ordinary. It has
                    the taste of royalty,
                    and is often eaten at celebrations and other special occasions.

                <h3> 6. Haleem:</h3>
                <p>Haleem is an Arabic dish. It is a popular stew made with meat—usually beef or mutton—lentils, barley,
                    and spices. It is
                    sold on street stalls and in bazaars (markets) as a snack, and making haleem involves a lengthy and
                    complex process. It
                    can be served with mint, lemon juice, coriander leaves, fried onions, ginger root, and green
                    chilies. Haleem is a high-calorie dish, providing protein from the meat and fiber and carbohydrates
                    from the combinations of grains and pulses. This is quite possibly why the dish is so popular for
                    breaking fast during Ramadan.

                <h3> 8. Mishti Doi:</h3>
                <p>This is the second most consumed food at festivals and celebrations after biryani. Here, the
                    tradition of eating
                    something sweet after a heavy meal is served by Misti Doi. Mishti Doi is fermented sweet dahi,
                    originating from the Bogra district of Bangladesh. It is mainly made with milk and
                    sugar, but it differs from plain yoghurt due to the preparation technique. Misti Doi tastes elegant
                    yet is comforting and sweet. It has a creamy, pudding-like texture with a deep, rich flavor of
                    dark caramel and a touch of acidity that makes it refreshing.

                    all over the Indian
                    subcontinent. Bengali people called it Shingara. But in the West it is generally know as samosa.
                    This tasty snack is a
                    fried or baked pastry filled with combinations of spiced potatoes, onions, peas, cheese, beef, and
                    lentils. It is served
                    with chutney, salad, or green chili.


                    Every middle-class restaurant in Bangladesh has Samosas outside their establishment to entice guests
                    in.

                <p>Dal isn’t unique to Bangladesh but it is so commonly eaten by Bangladeshi’s that it is unequivocally
                    worth mentioning. Dal is traditionally made by boiling the mix in water with salt and turmeric.

                    are sometimes added depending on taste, and then adding spices such as cumin, chili, onion, garlic
                    or mustard seeds, and
                    garnishing before serving. Naans, rotis, chapatis and other breads traditionally accompany dal, as
                    well as rice or vegetables.

                <p>This food differs depending on the season, the culture, and the place. The best time to sample hot
                    pitha is during
                    winter, particularly in rural areas on a winter morning, but it is eaten all year round. Pitha is a
                    light snack made
                    from dough or batter that is fried, steamed or baked. Bangladeshi cooks use their amazing skills to

                    designs with this food.


                    There are many varieties of traditional sweet pitha: Vapa pitha, Puli pitha, Pagan pitha, etc, and
                    making them requires
                    a lot of skill.

                <p>Shemai is a traditional dessert in Bangladesh. It is particularly popular at Eid, a celebration for
                    the distribution of
                    Happiness. But shemai is also consumed throughout the year. This dessert symbolizes happy moments in

                    Bangladesh, it is not a restaurant or street food; it is generally seen as a food for the family to
